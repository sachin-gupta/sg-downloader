Welcome to sg-downloader's documentation!
=========================================

This documentation is generated by Sphix for Python, Sachin Gupta. I've added project.rst and autocode.rst for
generation of additional pages to it. In order to generate project documentation you've to modify .rst files in
the docs folder and then run `make clean` followed with `make html`. This will render help output in docs/_build/html
folder. See autocode.rst file for inclusion of source code.
